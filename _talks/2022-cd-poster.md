My colleague Frank (Yuan Yao) and I presented a poster together at CD2022 in NYU. We won the BioTools top poster prize at the conference! See the winning letter [here](https://therobinsongroup.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/7_28_22-4_30-PM-Microsoft-Lens.pdf). This poster was the predecessor to our work [now published in ACS Nano](https://yougrass.github.io/publication/2022-extracting).
