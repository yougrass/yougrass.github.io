I presented a poster at the 2023 CHESS User Meeting on our synchrotron characterization done at both CHESS and Diamond Light Source. I was awarded the "Best Technical Poster" prize to recognize the "outstanding presentation of research based on the development of new instrumentation, new methods, and/or techniques at CHESS."
