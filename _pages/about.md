I'm a PhD Candidate in Applied Physics at Cornell University, doing my research in the [Robinson group](https://therobinsongroup.org/). The group broadly focuses on nanoscale materials for energy applications, but my research has specifically focused on the optical and structural properties of magic-sized clusters. In particular, I find polarization-dependent spectroscopy (i.e., polarimetry) to be a lot of fun! Feel free to have a look at my publications under the [publications tab](https://yougrass.github.io/publications/).

I earned my BSE in Engineering Physics at Case Western Reserve University, where I did a handful of research projects in topics ranging from semiconductor crystal growth to the fabrication of 2D field-effect transistors.
