permalink: /publication/2022-extracting
excerpt: 'This paper uses Stokes-Mueller formalism to derive a method to measure the circular dichroism (CD) signal from highly anisotropic samples that possess strong linear dichroism and birefringence (LD, LB). Samples with LD and LB (common for state-of-the-art samples, such as metamaterials or self-assembled nanostructures) will often present "apparent" CD, caused by misalignment between the LD and LB rather than a chiral chromophore. However, we demonstrated that this apparent CD signal can be removed by averaging over a series of measurements. We then applied the method to a series of standards to demonstrate its validity before finally applying it to the assemblies of CdS magic-sized clusters that we study in our group. These measurements revealed the chiroptic origin of the CdS assemblies (exciton coupling),  a structure-property relationship that we have since dug into much more, and very strong CD signals, 0.05, one of the largest reported values for inorganic semiconductors at the time of publication.'
